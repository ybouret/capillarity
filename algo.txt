We assume to have a spherical cap lens of radius R0, and a water profile described by the parametric curve (r(s),z(s)).
Let us define the reduced set of variables:
 u   = r/R0
 v   = z/R0
 tau = s/R0
 
We carry out the integration of
	du/dtau   = cos(phi)
	dv/dtau   = sin(phi)
	dphi/dtau = mu^2 * v - sin(phi)/u
	mu = R0/lambda (lambda=capillary length)

starting from
	u0   = sin(alpha)
	v0   = h/R0 + (1-cos(alpha))
	phi0 = alpha+theta-pi 

with the initial angle related to the measure area A according to
	alpha = arcsin(sqrt(A/(pi*R0^2)))

and a guess contact angle theta.
For any theta, the integration is performed using the adaptive Dormand-Prince 
method. We then look for the value which ensures a vanishing horizontal tangent (ie dv/dtau goes to zero) when the radius diverges (ie u goes to infinity).
